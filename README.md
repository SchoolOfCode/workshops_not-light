# Not Light Challenge

Your challenge is to create a whole webpage in just 15 minutes. Too easy you say? I hear you. Then the conditions are:

- You have to edit the [`index.html`](./index.html) file in the GitHub file editing interface. **Don't clone down the repo in VS Code!** Click on the index.html here in Github, and click on the pencil icon above the file to open the editor (still on the Github site).
- Write your CSS in the style tag - we've given you the font as a starter!
- You cannot use any external resources. The screenshot in the readme should be your only reference.
- You cannot preview your work until the very end of the task.

Good luck ðŸ˜ƒ
